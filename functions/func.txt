⭐ There are two kinds fo a function
       1) Pure Function  => Such functions are called pure because the do not attempt to
         change inputs.
         example:-

         function add(a,b)
         {
           return a+b;
         }  

       2) Inpure Function =>In contrast ,this function is impure because it changes it's 
         input
       example:-

       function withdraw(account,amount)
       {
         account.total-=amount;
       }
