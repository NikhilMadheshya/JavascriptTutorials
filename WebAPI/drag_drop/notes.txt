⭐⭐⭐ WEB API (DRAG AND DROP);

✏️HTML5 spec specifies that almost all elements can be draggable.
To make an element draggable, you add the draggable property with 
the value of true to its HTML tag.

Events on draggable elements
When you drag an element, these events fire in the following sequence:

⭐dragstart
⭐drag
⭐dragend

✏️When you hold a mouse button and begin to move the mouse, the dragstart 
event fires on the draggable element that you’re dragging. The cursor 
changes to a no-drop symbol (a circle with a line through it) to indicate 
that you cannot drop the element on itself.


⭐⭐Events on drop targets

When you drag an element over a valid drop target, these events fire in the following sequence:

dragenter
dragover
dragleave or drop


⭐⭐ Transfer data using dataTransfer object

To transfer data in a drag-and-drop action, you use the dataTransfer object.
The dataTransfer object is a property of the event. It allows you to transfer 
data from the dragged element to the drop target.

The dataTransfer object has two methods: setData() and getData().

✏️ The setData() allows you to set the drag operation’s data to the specified 
format and data:

✏️The getData() method retrieves the drag data stored by the setData() method.
