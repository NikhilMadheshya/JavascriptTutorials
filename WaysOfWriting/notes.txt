-------------->INLINE 
-------------->INTERNAL 
-------------->EXTERNALLY


⭐ Difference between async And defer attribute
⭐ Where should i write inside html file ?



1.Internal Way => Writing JS codes inside html file(based on no of lines)
2.External Way => Write JS codes outside html file(mostly use)
3.Inline => single line statement(rarelu use)


Async 
---------
When we use async attribute inside script tag then 
html parsing js codes fetching synchoronously start
but as soon as when js code fetching success then code of the 
javascript execute rather than waiting to parse html file.

Defer
--------
When we use defer attribute inside script tag then 
html parsing js codes fetching synchoronously start
but as soon as when js code fetching success then it 
will wait until html parsing is completed.
