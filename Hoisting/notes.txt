‚ù§Ô∏èAWESOME CONCEPT IN JAVASCRIPT

‚≠êWhat is Hoisting?

Only for learning purpose
 Ans: Hoisting is the concept in javascript where function defination and 
      variable declaraion move to the top of the program before exection.


ü§î But How ?
 Wait!
 Whenever you execute your js code a "GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT" is created.
 Think it like a big box or a container.It has two components

 (i) Memory Component => Where variabe and functions are allocated in 
                        a key value pair.Also called it as a variable 
                        environment.

(ii)Code  Component => Where  code is execute only one task at a time.
                       Also callesd it as Thread Of Execution.


Allocation of memory done first and for a time being variable is not innitialize
value undefined is stored as a temporary value.
What about function ?
Whole code is stored.

That's the reason we can be able to access the variable before innitialization.


                           GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     MEMORY COMPONENT                   |           CODE COMPONENT
     key:value,
     key:fun(){
        ......
    }

 üåüAfter Memory Allocation Coding Part Is DONE 




 üìùNote For each function calls "LOCAL EXECUTION CONTEXT IS CREATED" .
