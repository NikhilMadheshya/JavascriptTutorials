⭐⭐⭐ Regular Expression
⭐⭐⭐⭐Must Known To Each Developers

📝What is Regular Expression ?

Ans: An object that describes a pattern of characters which is used 
     to perform pattern matching and "search and replace".

📝Modifiers
   g   => perform a global match
   i   => perform case -insensitive match 
   m   => perform multiline matching


⭐ How complex is regex ❓ 

Ans: It's not complex first of all !
     Few people says i'ts 😱 because they don't know the use of regex symbols.
     But I am here to explain each symbol of regex 


   SYNTAX :-
     Example

    let str="someone@gmail.com"   
 
     let reg=new RegExp('pattern','modifier');  

     let reg=/pattern/modifier;




⭐⭐REGEX SYMBOLS 😃Yee!



 How do we describe with regex symbol❓

 Ans: We can describe in a series of occurence . 



❤️ We will cover basic form vaildaion pattern also later 
   you can use in your projects.
   Definitely reduce an efforts means single line is enough to validate 
   any specific characters.   


📝 There are mainly four types of symbols in regex
    1. Characters Sets
    2. Meta Characters
    3. Quantifiers
    4. Shorthand Characters







📝Character Sets:-

[A-Z]   => Used to find upercase letters
[a-z]   => Used to find lowercase letters
[0-9]   => Used to find a digits
[7a8bc] => Used to find a any characters inside square bracket
(a|8|@) => Used to find alternate characters inside square bracket

for non 
[^A-Z]   => Used to find non  upercase letters

📝Meta Characters :-

^    => match the string starts with
$    => match the string ends with
.    => used to match the single any character 
?    => match the optional character
*    => 0 or more occurence
+    => 1 or more occurence
(?=) => match the character followed by
\   => to escape regex character  


📝@uantifiers => Basically describe an occurence like how many
char{range}
char{min_range,max_range}

Shorthand Characters :-

\d => for digit
\D => for non digit
\s => for white space
\S => not for white space
\w => for word character
\W => for non word
\n => for line change
There are lots but this much is enough
