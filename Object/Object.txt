⭐ What is an object ?

Ans: In javascript an object is a encapsulted thing of properties and methods.
     Properties are nothing but a variable with values based on object.
     And method is a functions based on object.

     📝Basically used to describe  properties of any specific living or non living
     things.



     📝Syntax 
     ------
     scope_definer object_name={
         key1:value,
         key2:function()
         {

         },
        key3:value
     }
    
    Example :-

     let student={
        name:'someone',
        roll:23,
        getName:function()
        {
            return this.name;
        }
    }

    student.name // someone
    student.getName() // someone

    student['name'];
    student['getName']();
